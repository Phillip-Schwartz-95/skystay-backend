Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

Alugar um apartamento em outra cidade, outro país, além de ser mais barato do que hotel, possibilita uma maior interação com os moradores locais e um maior conhecimento sobre o seu modo de vida. Como são os supermercados e as padarias, o que vendem ali ? qual é o dia a dia da população?  Além disto não há horário para o café da manhã e posso fazer um lanche ou almoço se não quiser ir a um restaurante.\r\nProcuro trazer as minhas experiências de hospedagem para o meu apartamento, pois quero que o hóspede se sinta confortável, em casa.\r\nAlém de gostar muito de viajar, adoro ler e ouvir música e pretendo com o dinheiro que ganho hospedando, poder me hospedar mais pelo mundo a fora.

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. \r\n\r\nHong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nI'm new to Airbnb and open to suggestions on making your stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable experience. Nice to meet you!",

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

If you want really enjoyable holiday you should choose my home. At first read my all reviews and ask me all questions what you want to learn about Istanbul and other things. I'll help you all your travel. ",

I just recently renovated my whole house, pretty much a knock down job so new everything. I heard about air B&B and thought what a great idea. I have a clean house including a great kitchen so feel free to make yourself at home when you stay with me. Just let me know if there is anything in particular you may need. This is also the perfect room to shut yourself away in if that is what you'd prefer.",

I speak Portuguese and English and I love meeting new people from different cultures and languages!\r\n\r\nAs host:\r\nI hosted over 80 people in 2 years of Airbnb and we earned Super Hosts status 2 years in a row! \r\nMy husband Claudio is Italian and I'm Brazilian. We work from home and we are very fast replying guest messages when we are not here to answer in person. Despite our apartment being small, we have a comfortable size bedroom with a double bed and many cosy pillows so you can relax and rest after exploring Sydney! Also, we are 15 minutes walking distance to Coogee Beach (our favourite!).\r\n\r\nAs a traveller: \r\nI prefer quiet and relaxing homes and when travelling I barely stay on my Airbnb room as I am constantly exploring. I like to chat with my hosts to find out the best places to eat and see from a local's point of view as well as building friendship with my hosts.\r\nI either travel alone or with my Italian husband Claudio.
